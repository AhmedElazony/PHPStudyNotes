# Fundamental Concepts of OOP

### Class And Object
<strong>Classes and objects are the basic tools of achieving OOP</strong>
#### A Class:
> It's the model of anything in the real world.

#### An Object:
> It's the real Instance of the model of a thing in the real world.

#### Note:
_Every Class Has characterstics of its own:_
_These can be adjectives => variables/fields/attributes,_
_or actions => methods/functions._

### There are Four Fundamental Concepts of OOP:
#### Encapsulation (Information Hiding)
> Hiding Data And Complexity.	
#### Abstraction
> Making Things Simplified.
#### Inheritance
> A Class Can derive Characterstics from another class.
#### Polymorphism
> A Class Can implement an inherited method on its own way.
